# Types of STL: (stack, queue, list etc)
 It only works for generic programming.
 
 Types: 1. Container: (i) Associated set: Set, Map, multiset, multimap
                      (ii) Derived set: stack, queue, priority queue.
                      (iii) Sequence Set: vector, deque, list
           Algorithms
           Iterator.
           
vector: a vector is a class that creates a dynamic array alowing insertions and deletions at the back.

list: list is the sequence containers that allow the insertions and deletions from anywhere.

deque: deque is the double ended queue that allows the insertion and deletion from both the ends.

set: set is an associate container for storing unique sets.

multiset: multiset is an associate container for storing non-unique sets.

map: map is an associate container for storing unique key value pairs i.e., each key is associated with only one value.

multimap: It is an associate container for storing key-value pair, and each key can be associated with more than one value.

stack: it follows last in first out

queue: it follows first in first out

priority queue: first element out is always the highest priority element
